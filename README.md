# Nodeaccess - Per Node Access Management for Drupal 7-9

## INTRODUCTION

---

This module is now fully Drupal 9 compatible and will be maintained to remain so.
Many interface and feature enhancements have been made as part of the code cleanup
and the fixing of bugs. Please see the GitHub Wiki for this project to get a complete
set of documentation on how to use this module as well as how to update form previous
versions of Nodeaccess that have been hosted on Drupal.org. This is also the place
to learn how to configure Nodeaccess. That information has been removed from this file
as it was tough to understand without the visuals.

This module allows you to manage permissions for nodes by role and user. In
other words, it implements per node access control for users and groups. With
this module, you can restrict access to any individual node without having to
use taxonomy. You can assign permission to view, edit or delete each
individual node by user or role. Once enabled, a 'grant' tab will appear on
node pages. You can click this and assign permissions for that node.
